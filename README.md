## üß© Detailed Process Flow

### **1. Data Source**
- **Input Data**: Tokyo Olympic dataset containing details about countries, athletes, events, and medals.
- Data format: CSV/JSON files.

### **2. Data Ingestion (Azure Data Factory)**
- Orchestrated pipelines to extract raw data from the source.
- Scheduled pipelines to ensure periodic refresh.
- Data validation performed before storage.

### **3. Raw Data Storage (Azure Data Lake Gen 2)**
- Data stored in **Raw Zone** for archival purposes.
- Used as a single source of truth for unprocessed datasets.

### **4. Data Transformation (Azure Databricks)**
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.
- Data transformation: Aggregation, normalization, and feature engineering using **PySpark & SQL**.
- Business logic implementation: Medal tally, gender-wise participation, country-wise performance.

### **5. Transformed Data Storage (Azure Data Lake Gen 2)**
- Data moved to **Processed Zone** for downstream analytics.
- Partitioned and structured for faster query performance.

### **6. Data Modeling & Analytics (Azure Synapse Analytics)**
- Created **SQL-based models** for reporting.
- Optimized queries using materialized views and indexing.
- Enabled data exploration for BI tools.

### **7. Visualization & Dashboarding**
- Connected **Power BI, Looker Studio, and Tableau** for interactive dashboards.
- Key visualizations include:
  - Medal tally by country & sport.
  - Participation trends over events.
  - Gender-wise analysis.
  - Top-performing athletes.
